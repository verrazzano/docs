OAM Components are reusable component templates that can be used and configured by Verrazzano applications.

To view all the existing Components, on the Home page, under Resources, select **Components**.

The Components are displayed with the following information:
   - Name: The name of the component; links to the [Components Details]({{< relref "/docs/console/components/componentdetails" >}}).
   - Namespace: The namespace in which the component is available.
   - Workload Type: The type of Workload created by the component.
   - Cluster: The cluster in which the component is available.
   - Project: The component Project; in some cases, a multicluster Component.

You can sort Components based on Name, Namespace, Workload Type, Cluster, and Project, or filter them based on Project and cluster.

For more information, see [Components]({{< relref "/docs/applications/#components" >}}).
