The Verrazzano platform comprises a comprehensive set of open source components, linked together to provide a modern, reliable, and secure platform to deploy cloud native applications.
The focus of this document is to help users back up and restore data and configurations stored in Keycloak, Opensearch and Rancher. The backup procedures documented here are independent of each other and can be invoked in the order of users choice.  
The document also relies mostly on OCI Object store as a backend for most of the backup functionality.
