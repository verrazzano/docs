Verrazzano is an end-to-end enterprise container platform for deploying cloud-native and traditional applications in multi-cloud and hybrid environments. It is made up of a curated set of open source components – many that you may already use and trust, and some that were written specifically to pull together all of the pieces that make Verrazzano a cohesive and easy to use platform.

Verrazzano includes the following capabilities:

* Hybrid and multi-cluster workload management
* Special handling for WebLogic, Coherence, and Helidon applications
* Multi-cluster infrastructure management
* Integrated and pre-wired application monitoring
* Integrated security
* DevOps and GitOps enablement

This is a developer preview release of Verrazzano. It is intended for installation in a single cluster on
[Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Container Engine for Kubernetes (OKE)](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ContEng/Concepts/contengoverview.htm)
or [Oracle Linux Cloud Native Environment (OLCNE)](https://docs.oracle.com/en/operating-systems/olcne/).
You should install Verrazzano only in a cluster that can be safely deleted when your evaluation is complete.
