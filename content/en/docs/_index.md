Verrazzano is an end-to-end enterprise container platform for deploying cloud-native and traditional applications in multi-cloud and hybrid environments. It is made up of a curated set of open source components â€“ many that you may already use and trust, and some that were written specifically to pull together all of the pieces that make Verrazzano a cohesive and easy to use platform.

**NOTE**: This is an early alpha release of Verrazzano. Some features are still in development. It is suitable for investigation and educational purposes only; it is _not_ suitable for use in production.

Verrazzano includes the following capabilities:

* Hybrid and multi-cluster workload management
* Special handling for WebLogic, Coherence, and Helidon applications
* Multi-cluster infrastructure management
* Integrated and pre-wired application monitoring
* Integrated security
* DevOps and GitOps enablement
