If you enable Thanos on the managed clusters, Verrazzano installs the required set of Thanos components on the managed clusters. Then, on the administrator cluster, Verrazzano automatically configures the managed clusterâ€™s Thanos endpoint in Thanos Query. This allows you to query metrics across all clusters from Thanos Query on the administrator cluster.

If Thanos is disabled on a managed cluster, then Verrazzano uses the Prometheus federation to scrape metrics from the managed cluster.

When enabling long-term metric storage in object storage, it is recommended to use a separate bucket for each managed cluster. This provides metric data isolation and improves overall query performance.

The following is a representation of metrics collection in a multicluster environment.
