### Summary
Analysis detected that the Verrazzano installation failed while installing the NGINX Ingress Controller.

The root cause appears to be that the load balancer service limit has been reached.

### Steps
1. Review the messages from the supporting details for the exact limits, and delete unused load balancers.
2. If available, use a different load balancer shape. See [Customizing Ingress]({{< relref "/docs/customize/ingress.md" >}}).
3. Refer to the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure documentation on [Service Limits](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/servicelimits.htm#).
