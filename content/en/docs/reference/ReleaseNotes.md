### v0.8.0
- Features
    - Support for two installation profiles, development (`dev`) and production (`prod`).  The production profile, which is the default, provides a 3-node Elasticsearch and persistent storage for the Verrazzano Monitoring Instance (VMI). The development profile provides a single node Elasticsearch and no persistent storage for the VMI.   
    - The default behavior has been changed to use the system VMI for all monitoring (applications and Verrazzano components).  It is still possible to customize one of the profiles to enable the original, non-shared VMI mode.
    - Initial support for the Open Application Model (OAM).
- Fixes
    - Updated Axios NPM package to v0.21.1 to resolve a security vulnerability in the examples code.

### v.0.7.0
- Features
    - Ability to upgrade an existing Verrazzano installation.
    - Added the Verrazzano Console.
    - Enhanced the structure of the Verrazzano custom resource to allow more configurability.
    - Streamlined the secret usage for OCI DNS installations.

- Fixes
    - Fixed bug where the Verrazzano CR `Certificate.CA` fields were being ignored.
    - Removed secret used for `hello-world`; `hello-world-application` image is now public in ghcr so `ImagePullSecrets` is no longer needed.
    - Fixed [issue #339](https://github.com/verrazzano/verrazzano/issues/339) (PRs [#208](https://github.com/verrazzano/verrazzano-operator/pull/208) & [#210](https://github.com/verrazzano/verrazzano-operator/pull/210).)

### v0.6.0
- Features
    - In-cluster installer which replaces client-side install scripts.
    - Added installation profiles; in this release, there are two: production and development.
    - Verrazzano system components now emit JSON structured logs.
- Fixes
    - Updated Elasticsearch and Kibana versions (elasticsearch:7.6.1-20201130145440-5c76ab1) and (kibana:7.6.1-20201130145840-7717e73).
