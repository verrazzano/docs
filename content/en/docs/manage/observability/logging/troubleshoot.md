If you are not able to view Verrazzano logs in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Logging, then check the Fluentd container logs in the cluster to see if there are errors.

```
$ kubectl logs -n verrazzano-system -l app=fluentd --tail=-1
```

If you see `not authorized` error messages, then there is likely a problem with the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Dynamic Group or IAM policy that is preventing the Fluentd plug-in from communicating with the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure API.

To ensure the appropriate permissions are in place, review the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Logging [required permissions](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Logging/Task/managinglogs.htm#required_permissions_logs_groups) documentation.
