Verrazzano supports Kubernetes Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for Verrazzano resources, and integrates with Keycloak to enable Single Sign-On (SSO) across Verrazzano console and the various logging and metrics consoles. We provide proxies that enable SSO and Kubernetes API access for Keycloak user accounts.

For information on how Verrazzano secures network traffic, see [Network Security]({{< relref "/docs/networking/security/net-security.md" >}}) in the [Networking]({{< relref "/docs/networking/_index.md" >}}) section.
