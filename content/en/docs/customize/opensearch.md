Verrazzano supports two cluster topologies for an OpenSearch cluster:
- A single-node cluster (master, ingest, and data roles performed by a single node).
- A multi-node cluster configuration with separate master, data, and ingest nodes.

[Installation Profiles]({{< relref "/docs/setup/install/profiles.md" >}}) describes the default OpenSearch cluster
configurations provided by Verrazzano.
## Plan cluster topology

Start with an initial estimate of your hardware needs. The following recommendations will provide you with initial, educated estimates, but for ideal sizing, you will need to test them with representative workloads, monitor their performance, and then reiterate.

- Storage Requirements

  \\(s\\) = stored data size in GiB ( log size per day * days to retain )

  \\(sr\\) = shard replica count per index

  \\(o\\) = overall overhead which is a constant = 1.45

  Minimum storage requirement = \\( ( s * ( 1 + sr ) ) * o \\)

  For an example, if you have

  \\(s\\) = 66 GiB ( 6 GiB of log size per day * 11 days to retain ) and if you choose one shard replica per index which makes \\(sr\\) = 1

  Then minimum storage requirement = \\((66 * (1 + 1) ) * 1.45\\) = 192 GiB

  _Overhead_ defined above can be further explained as

  \\(io\\) = indexing overhead ( extra space used other than the actual data which is generally 10%( 0.1 ) of the index size ) = 0.1

  \\(lrs\\) = Linux reserved space( Linux reserves 5% of the file system for the root user for some OS operations = 0.05

  \\(oo\\)  = OpenSearch overhead ( OpenSearch keeps 20% in worst case, of the instance for segment merges, logs, and other internal operations = 0.8

   overhead \\(o\\) =  (1 + io ) ) / lrs ) / (1 - oo ) = 1.45

- Memory

  For every 100 GiB of your storage requirement, you should have 8 GiB of memory.

  With reference to example, for 192 GiB of storage requirement, you need 16 GiB of memory.


- Number of Data Nodes

  \\(ts\\) =  total storage in GiB 

  \\(mem\\) = memory per data node in GiB

  \\(md\\) = memory:data ratio ( 1:30 ratio means that you have 30 times larger storage on the node than you have RAM, and value used would be 30 )

  \\(fc\\) = one data node for fail over capacity which is a constant = 1

  ROUNDUP \\(ts / mem / md  + fc\\)

  With reference to example

  \\(ts\\) = 192 GiB , \\(mem\\) = 8 GiB , \\(md\\) = 1:10 and \\(fc\\) = 1

  Number of data nodes = ROUNDUP \\( 192 / 8 / 10  + 1 \\) = 3


- JVM heap memory

  The heap size is the amount of RAM allocated to the Java Virtual Machine of an OpenSearch node. The OpenSearch process is very memory intensive and close to 50% of the memory available on a node should be allocated to the JVM. The JVM machine uses memory for indexing and search operations. The other 50% is required for the file system cache, which keeps data that is regularly accessed in memory.
  As a general rule, you should set `-Xms` and `-Xmx` to the same value, which should be 50% of your total available RAM, subject to a maximum of ( approximately ) 31 GiB.


- CPU

  Hardware requirements vary dramatically by workload, but, typically, two vCPU cores for every 100 GiB of your storage requirement is sufficient.

  With reference to example, for 192 GiB, vCPU cores required are four.


- Shard Size

  For logging, shard sizes between 10 GiB and 50 GiB typically perform well.
  For search-intensive operations, 10-25 GiB typically is a good shard size. Overall, it is a best practice that, for a single shard, the OpenSearch shard size should not go above 50GiB. When the shards exceed 50 GiB, you will have to reindex your data.


- Primary shards count

  \\(s\\) = stored data size in GiB ( log size per day * days to retain )

  \\(sh\\) = desired shard size in GiB 
   
   \\(io\\) = indexing overhead ( extra space used other than the actual data which is generally 10% of the index size ) = 0.1

  Primary shards = \\( ( s * (1 + io) ) / sh \\)

  With reference to example, \\(s\\) = 66 GiB and if you choose shard size \\(sh\\) = 30 GiB

  Then primary shards count = \\( ( 66 * 1.1 )/ 30 \\) = 2



## Recommended alarms
You can [customize Prometheus]({{< relref "/docs/customize/Prometheus.md" >}}) to enable Alertmanager and configure recommended alarms (add alert rules) to get insight into your OpenSearch cluster and take some actions proactively.

Use the `OSDataNodeFilesystemSpaceFillingUp` alert to indicate that the OpenSearch average disk usage has exceeded the specified threshold. Adjust the alert thresholds according to your needs.
   ```yaml
   kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
   apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
   kind: PrometheusRule
   metadata:
     labels:
       release: prometheus-operator
     name: prometheus-operator-os
     namespace: verrazzano-monitoring
   spec:
     groups:
       - name: os
         rules:
           - alert: OSDataNodeFilesystemSpaceFillingUp
             annotations:
               runbook_url: <link to runbook>
               summary: Opensearch average disk usage exceeded 75%.
             expr: |-
               1 - (es_fs_total_available_bytes{node=~".*data.*"}/ es_fs_total_total_bytes) > .75
             for: 30m
             labels:
               severity: warning
     EOF
  ```


## Configure cluster topology

You can customize the node characteristics of your OpenSearch cluster by using the
[spec.components.opensearch.nodes](/docs/reference/api/vpo-verrazzano-v1beta1/#install.verrazzano.io/v1beta1.OpenSearchNode)
field in the Verrazzano custom resource.  When installing or upgrading Verrazzano, you can use this field to
define an OpenSearch cluster using node groups.

The following example overrides the `dev` installation profile, OpenSearch configuration (a single-node cluster with
1Gi of memory and ephemeral storage) to use a multi-node cluster (three master nodes, and three combination data/ingest nodes) with persistent storage.

```yaml
apiVersion: install.verrazzano.io/v1beta1
kind: Verrazzano
metadata:
  name: custom-opensearch-example
spec:
  profile: dev
  components:
    opensearch:
      nodes:
        - name: master
          replicas: 3
          roles:
            - master
          storage:
            size: 50Gi
          resources:
            requests:
              memory: 1.5Gi
        - name: data-ingest
          replicas: 3
          roles:
            - data
            - ingest
          storage:
            size: 100Gi
          resources:
            requests:
              memory: 1Gi
        # Override the default node groups because we are providing our own topology.
        - name: os-master
          replicas: 0
        - name: os-data
          replicas: 0
        - name: os-ingest
          replicas: 0
```

Listing the pods and persistent volumes in the `verrazzano-system` namespace for the previous configuration
shows the expected nodes are running with the appropriate data volumes.

```
$ kubectl get pvc,pod -l verrazzano-component=opensearch -n verrazzano-system

## Configure Index State Management policies

[Index State Management](https://opensearch.org/docs/1.3/im-plugin/ism/index/) policies configure OpenSearch to manage the data in your indices.
Policies can be used to automatically rollover and prune old data, preventing your OpenSearch
cluster from running out of disk space.

The following policy example configures OpenSearch to manage indices matching the pattern `my-app-*`. The data in these indices will be
automatically pruned every 14 days, and will be rolled over if an index meets at least one of the following criteria:
- Is three or more days old
- Contains 1,000 documents or more
- Is 10GB in size or larger

```yaml
apiVersion: install.verrazzano.io/v1beta1
kind: Verrazzano
metadata:
  name: custom-opensearch-example
spec:
  profile: dev
  components:
    opensearch:
      policies:
        - policyName: my-app
          indexPattern: my-app-*
          minIndexAge: 14d
          rollover:
            minIndexAge: 3d
            minDocCount: 1000
            minSize: 10Gb
```
