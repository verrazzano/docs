This guide describes how to move ("Lift-and-Shift") an on-premises WebLogic Server domain to a cloud environment running Kubernetes using Verrazzano.

## Overview

The [Initial steps](#initial-steps) create a very simple on-premises domain that you will move to Kubernetes.  The sample domain is the starting point for the lift and shift process; it contains one application (ToDo List) and one data source.  First, you'll configure the database and the WebLogic Server domain.  Then, in [Lift and Shift](#lift-and-shift-steps), you will move the domain to Kubernetes with Verrazzano.  This guide does not include the setup of the networking that would be needed to access an on-premises database, nor does it document how to migrate a database to the cloud.  

## What you need

- The [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) command-line tool and access to [GitHub](https://github.com)

- [MySQL Database 8.x](https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql) - a database server

- [WebLogic Server 12.2.1.4.0](https://www.oracle.com/middleware/technologies/weblogic-server-downloads.html) - an application server; Note that all WebLogic Server installers are supported _except_ the Quick Installer.

- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) - to build the application

- [WebLogic Deploy Tooling](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-deploy-tooling/releases) (WDT) - v1.9.15 or later, to convert the WebLogic Server domain to and from metadata

- [WebLogic Image Tool](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-image-tool/releases) (WIT) - v1.9.13 or later, to build the Docker image

## Initial steps

In the initial steps, you create a sample domain that represents your on-premises WebLogic Server domain.

### Create a database using MySQL called `tododb`

1. Download the [MySQL image](https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql) from Docker Hub.
    ```
    $ docker pull mysql:latest
    ```
1. Start the container database (and optionally mount a volume for data).
    ```
    $ docker run --name tododb \
      -p 3306:3306 \
      -e MYSQL_USER=derek \
      -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=welcome1 \
      -e MYSQL_DATABASE=tododb \
      -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=welcome1 \
      -d mysql:latest
    ```

   {{< alert title="NOTE" color="tip" >}}
   You should use a more secure password.
   {{< /alert >}}

1. Start a MySQL client to change the password algorithm to `mysql_native_password`.
    - Assuming the database server is running, start a database CLI client.
        ```shell script
        $ docker exec \
           -it tododb mysql \
           -uroot \
           -p
        ```
    - When prompted for the password, enter the password for the root user, `welcome1` or
    whatever password you set when starting the container in the previous step.  
    - After being connected, run the `ALTER` command at the MySQL prompt.
        ```mysql
        $ ALTER USER 'derek'@'%' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'welcome1';
        ```

   {{< alert title="NOTE" color="tip" >}}
   You should use a more secure password.
   {{< /alert >}}

### Create a WebLogic Server domain
1. If you do not have WebLogic Server 12.2.1.4.0 installed, install it now.  
   - Choose the `GENERIC` installer from [WebLogic Server Downloads](https://www.oracle.com/middleware/technologies/weblogic-server-downloads.html) and follow the documented installation instructions.
   - Be aware of these domain limitations:

        - There are two supported domain types, single server and single cluster.
        - Domains must use:
            - The default value `AdminServer` for `AdminServerName`.
            - WebLogic Server listen port for the Administration Server: `7001`.
            - WebLogic Server listen port for the Managed Server: `8001`.
            - Note that these are all standard WebLogic Server default values.

   - Save the installer after you have finished; you will need it to build the Docker image.  

   - To make copying commands easier, define an environment variable for `ORACLE_HOME` that points to the directory where you installed WebLogic Server 12.2.1.4.0.  For example:

     ```shell script
     $ export ORACLE_HOME=$HOME/Oracle/Middleware/Oracle_Home
     ```

1. Use the Oracle WebLogic Server Configuration Wizard to create a domain called `tododomain`.
   * Launch `$ORACLE_HOME/oracle_common/common/bin/config.sh`.
   * Select **Create a new domain**.
   * Specify a `Domain Location` of `<oracle home>/user_projects/domains/tododomain` and click **Next**.
   * Select the **Basic WebLogic Server Domain [wlserver]** template and click **Next**.
   * Enter the password for the administrative user (the examples here assume a password of "welcome1") and click **Next**.
   * Accept the defaults for `Domain Mode` and `JDK`, and click **Next**.
   * Select **Administration Server** and click **Next**.
   * Ensure that the server name is `AdminServer` and click **Next**.
   * Click **Create**.
   * After it has completed, click **Next**, then **Finish**.

1. To start the newly created domain, run the domain's start script.

    ```shell script
     $ $ORACLE_HOME/user_projects/domains/tododomain/bin/startWebLogic.sh
    ```
1. Access the Console of the newly started domain with your browser, for example, [http://localhost:7001/console](http://localhost:7001/console), and
   log in using the administrator credentials you specified.

### Add a data source configuration to access the database

Using the WebLogic Server Administration Console, log in and add a data source configuration to access the MySQL database. During the data source configuration, you can accept the default values for most fields, but the following fields are required to match the application and database settings you used when you created the MySQL database.

1. In the left pane in the Console, expand **Services** and select **Data Sources**.

1. On the Summary of JDBC Data Sources page, click **New** and select **Generic Data Source**.

1. On the JDBC Data Sources page, enter or select the following information:

    - Name: `tododb`
    - JNDI Name: `jdbc/ToDoDB`
    - Database Type: `MySQL`

1. Click **Next** and then click **Next** two more times.

1. On the Create a New JDBC Data Source page, enter the following information:

    - Database Name: `tododb`
    - Host name: `localhost`
    - Database Port: `3306`
    - Database User Name: `derek`
    - Password: `welcome1` (or whatever password you used)
    - Confirm Password: `welcome1`

1. Click **Next**.

1. Select **Test Configuration**, and make sure you see "Connection Test Succeeded" in the `Messages` field of the Console.

    ![Connection test](../../images/jdbc-connection-test.png)

1. Click **Next**.

1. On the Select Targets page, select `AdminServer`.

1. Click **Finish** to complete the configuration.


### Build and deploy the application

1. Using Maven, build this project to produce `todo.war`.

   **NOTE**: You should clone this repo outside of `$ORACLE_HOME` or copy the WAR
   file to another location, as WDT may ignore it during the model creation phase.

   ```shell script
    $ git clone https://github.com/verrazzano/examples.git
    $ cd examples/todo-list/
    $ mvn clean package
   ```

2. Using the WebLogic Server Administration Console, deploy the ToDo List application.  

   - In the left pane in the Console, select **Deployments** and click **Install**.
   - Use the navigation links or provide the file path to `todo.war` typically `<repo>/todo-list/target`.  For example, if you cloned the examples
     repository in your `$HOME` directory, the location should be `$HOME/examples/examples/todo-list/target/todo.war`.
   - Click **Next** twice, then **Finish**.

   **NOTE**: The remaining steps assume that the application context is `todo`.

### Initialize the database
After the application is deployed and running in WebLogic Server, access the `http://localhost:7001/todo/rest/items/init`
REST service to create the database table used by the application. In addition to creating the application table,
the `init` service also will load four sample items into the table.

If you get an error here, go back to the Select Targets page in the WebLogic Server Administration Console and make sure
that you selected `AdminServer` as the data source target.

### Access the application

- Access the application at `http://localhost:7001/todo/index.html`.  

![ToDoList](../../images/ToDoList.png)

- Add a few entries or delete some.
- After verifying the application and database, you may shut down the local WebLogic Server domain.

## Lift and Shift steps

The following steps will move the sample domain to Kubernetes with Verrazzano.

### Create a WDT Model

- If you have not already done so, download v1.9.15 or later of [WebLogic Deploy Tooling](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-deploy-tooling/releases) (WDT) from GitHub.
- Unzip the installer `weblogic-deploy.zip` file so that you can access `bin/discoverDomain.sh`.
- To make copying commands easier, define an environment variable for `WDT_HOME` that points to the directory where you installed WebLogic Deploy Tooling.
   ```shell script
    $ export WDT_HOME=/install/directory
   ```

For example, to get the latest version:

```shell
$ curl -OL https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-deploy-tooling/releases/latest/download/weblogic-deploy.zip
$ unzip  weblogic-deploy.zip
$ cd weblogic-deploy
$ export WDT_HOME=$(pwd)
```

To create a reusable model of the application and domain, use WDT to create a metadata model of the domain.  
- First, create an output directory to hold the generated scripts and models.  
- Then, run WDT `discoverDomain`.
  ```shell script
  $ mkdir v8o
  $ $WDT_HOME/bin/discoverDomain.sh \
    -oracle_home $ORACLE_HOME \
    -domain_home /path/to/domain/dir \
    -model_file ./v8o/wdt-model.yaml \
    -archive_file ./v8o/wdt-archive.zip \
    -target vz \
    -output_dir v8o
  ```

You will find the following files in `./v8o`:
- `create_k8s_secrets.sh` - A helper script with `kubectl` commands to apply the Kubernetes secrets needed for this domain
- `vz-application.yaml` - Verrazzano application configuration and component file
- `vz_variable.properties` - A set of properties extracted from the WDT domain model
- `wdt-archive.zip` - The WDT archive file containing the ToDo List application WAR file
- `wdt-model.yaml` - The WDT model of the WebLogic Server domain

If you chose to skip the [Access the application](#access-the-application) step and did not verify that the ToDo List application was deployed, then you should verify that you see the `todo.war` file inside the `wdt-archive.zip` file.  If you do not see the WAR file, there was something wrong in your deployment of the application on WebLogic Server that will require additional troubleshooting in your domain.

### Create a Docker image
At this point, the Verrazzano model is just a template for the real model.  The WebLogic Image Tool will
fill in the placeholders for you, or you can edit the model manually to set the image name and domain home directory.

- If you have not already done so, download [WebLogic Image Tool](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-image-tool/releases) (WIT) from GitHub.
- Unzip the installer `imagetool.zip` file so that you can access `bin/imagetool.sh`.
- To make copying commands easier, define an environment variable for `WIT_HOME` that points to the directory where you installed WebLogic Image Tool.
   ```shell script
    $ export WIT_HOME=/install/directory
   ```

For example, to get the latest WIT tool:

```shell
$ curl -OL https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-image-tool/releases/latest/download/imagetool.zip
$ unzip imagetool.zip
$ cd imagetool
$ export WIT_HOME=$(pwd)
```
You will need a Docker image to run your WebLogic Server domain in Kubernetes.  To use WIT to
create the Docker image, run `imagetool create`.  Although WIT will download patches and PSUs for you, it does not yet
download installers.  Until then, you must download the [WebLogic Server](https://www.oracle.com/middleware/technologies/weblogic-server-downloads.html)
and [Java Development Kit](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase8u211-later-archive-downloads.html) installer
manually and provide their location to the `imagetool cache addInstaller` command.

```shell script
# The directory created previously to hold the generated scripts and models.
$ cd v8o

$ $WIT_HOME/bin/imagetool.sh cache addInstaller \
  --path /path/to/installer/jdk-8u231-linux-x64.tar.gz \
  --type jdk \
  --version 8u231

# The installer file name may be slightly different depending on
# which version of the 12.2.1.4.0 installer that you downloaded, slim or generic.
$ $WIT_HOME/bin/imagetool.sh cache addInstaller \
  --path /path/to/installer/fmw_12.2.1.4.0_wls_Disk1_1of1.zip \
  --type wls \
  --version 12.2.1.4.0

$ $WIT_HOME/bin/imagetool.sh cache addInstaller \
  --path /path/to/installer/weblogic-deploy.zip \
  --type wdt \
  --version latest

# Paths for the files in this command assume that you are running it from the
# v8o directory created during the `discoverDomain` step.
$ $WIT_HOME/bin/imagetool.sh create \
  --tag your/repo/todo:1 \
  --version 12.2.1.4.0 \
  --jdkVersion 8u231 \
  --wdtModel ./wdt-model.yaml \
  --wdtArchive ./wdt-archive.zip \
  --wdtVariables ./vz_variable.properties \
  --resourceTemplates=./vz-application.yaml \
  --wdtModelOnly
```

The `imagetool create` command will have created a local Docker image and updated the Verrazzano model with the domain home
and image name.  Check your Docker images for the tag that you used in the `create` command using `docker images` from the Docker
CLI.  

If everything worked correctly, it is time to push that image to the container registry that Verrazzano will use to access
the image from Kubernetes. You can use the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Registry (OCIR) as your repository for this
example, but most Docker compliant registries should work.

The variables in the `vz-application.yaml` resource template should be resolved with information from the image tool build.  
Verify this by looking in the `v8o/vz-application.yaml` file to make sure that the `image: {{{imageName}}}` value has been
set with the given `--tag` value.

Push the image to your repo.

**NOTE:** The image name must be the same as what is in the `vz-application.yaml` file under
`spec > workload > spec > image` for the `tododomain-domain` component.

```shell script
$ docker push your/repo/todo:1
```

### Deploy to Verrazzano

After the application image has been created, there are several steps required to deploy a
the application into a Verrazzano environment.

These include:
1. Creating and labeling the `tododomain` namespace.
1. Creating the necessary secrets required by the ToDo List application.
1. Deploying MySQL to the `tododomain` namespace.
1. Updating the `vz-application.yaml` file to use the Verrazzano MySQL deployment and (optionally) expose the WLS Console.
1. Applying the `vz-application.yaml` file.

The following steps assume that you have a Kubernetes cluster and that [Verrazzano]({{< relref "/quickstart.md#install-verrazzano" >}}) is already installed in that cluster.

#### Label the namespace

Create the `tododomain` namespace, and add labels to allow the WebLogic Server Kubernetes Operator to manage it and
enabled for Istio.

```shell
$ kubectl create namespace tododomain
$ kubectl label namespace tododomain verrazzano-managed=true istio-injection=enabled
```

#### Create the required secrets

If you haven't already done so, edit and run the `create_k8s_secrets.sh` script to generate the Kubernetes secrets.
WDT does not discover passwords from your existing domain.  Before running the create secrets script, you will need to
edit `create_k8s_secrets.sh` to set the passwords for the WebLogic Server domain and the data source.  In this domain,
there are a few passwords that you need to enter:
* Administrator credentials (for example, `weblogic/welcome1`)
* ToDo database credentials (for example, `derek/welcome1`)
* Runtime encryption secret (for example, `welcome1`)

For example:
```shell script
# Update <admin-user> and <admin-password> for weblogic-credentials
$ create_paired_k8s_secret weblogic-credentials weblogic welcome1

# Update <user> and <password> for tododomain-jdbc-tododb
$ create_paired_k8s_secret jdbc-tododb derek welcome1

# Update <password> used to encrypt hashes
$ create_k8s_secret runtime-encryption-secret welcome1
```

Then run the script:

```shell
$ sh ./create_k8s_secrets.sh
```

Verrazzano will need a credential to pull the image that you just created, so you need to create one more secret.
The name for this credential can be changed in the `vz-application.yaml` file to anything you like, but it defaults to `tododomain-registry-credentials`.

Assuming that you leave the name `tododomain-registry-credentials`, you will need to run a `kubectl create secret` command similar to the following:
```shell script
$ kubectl create secret docker-registry tododomain-registry-credentials \
  --docker-server=phx.ocir.io \
  --docker-email=your.name@company.com \
  --docker-username=tenancy/username \
  --docker-password='passwordForUsername' \
  --namespace=tododomain
```

#### Update the application configuration

Update the generated `vz-application.yaml` file for the `todo` application to:

* Update the `tododomain-configmap` component to use the in-cluster MySQL service URL `jdbc:mysql://mysql.tododomain.svc.cluster.local:3306/tododb` to access the database.

```yaml
        wdt_jdbc.yaml: |
          resources:
            JDBCSystemResource:
              'todo-ds':
                JdbcResource:
                  JDBCDriverParams:
                    # This is the URL of the database used by the WebLogic Server application
                    URL: "jdbc:mysql://mysql.tododomain.svc.cluster.local:3306/tododb"
```

The file  [vz-application-modified.yaml](../vz-application-modified.yaml) is an example of a modified [vz-application.yaml](../vz-application.yaml) file.  A diff of these
two sample files is shown:

```shell
$ diff vz-application.yaml vz-application-modified.yaml
102c102
<                   URL: "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/tododb"
---
>                   URL: "jdbc:mysql://mysql.tododomain.svc.cluster.local:3306/tododb"
```

#### Deploy MySQL

As noted previously, moving a production environment to Verrazzano would require migrating the
data as well.  While data migration is beyond the scope of this guide, we will still need to
include a MySQL instance to be deployed with the application in the Verrazzano environment.

To do so, download the [mysql-oam.yaml](../mysql-oam.yaml) file.

Then, apply the YAML file:

```shell
$ kubectl apply -f mysql-oam.yaml
```

Wait for the MySQL pod to reach the `Ready` state.

```shell
$ kubectl get pod -n tododomain -w
NAME                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
mysql-5cfd58477b-mg5c7          0/1     Pending             0          0s
mysql-5cfd58477b-mg5c7          0/1     Pending             0          0s
mysql-5cfd58477b-mg5c7          0/1     ContainerCreating   0          0s
mysql-5cfd58477b-mg5c7          1/1     Running             0          2s
```
#### Deploy the ToDo List application

Finally, run `kubectl apply` to apply the Verrazzano component and Verrazzano application configuration files to start your domain.

```shell script
$ kubectl apply -f vz-application.yaml
```

This will:
* Create the application component resources for the ToDo List application.
* Create the application configuration resources that create the instance of the ToDo List application in the Verrazzano cluster.

Wait for the ToDo List example application to be ready.

```shell
$ kubectl wait pod --for=condition=Ready tododomain-adminserver -n tododomain
pod/tododomain-adminserver condition met
```

Verify the pods are in the `Running` state:
```shell
$ kubectl get pod -n tododomain
NAME                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
mysql-55bb4c4565-c8zf5   1/1     Running   0          8m
tododomain-adminserver   4/4     Running   0          5m
```

#### Access the application from your browser

1. Get the generated host name for the application.
   ```
   $ kubectl get gateway tododomain-tododomain-appconf-gw -n tododomain -o jsonpath={.spec.servers[0].hosts[0]}
   tododomain-appconf.tododomain.11.22.33.44.nip.io
   ```

1. Initialize the database by accessing the `init` URL.
   ```
   https://tododomain-appconf.tododomain.11.22.33.44.nip.io/todo/rest/items/init
   ```

1. Access the application
   ```
   http://tododomain-appconf.tododomain.11.22.33.44.nip.io/todo
   ```

#### Access the WebLogic Server Administration Console

1. Set up port forwarding.
   ```
   $ kubectl port-forward pods/tododomain-adminserver 7001:7001 -n tododomain
   ```

1. Access the WebLogic Server Administration Console from your browser.
   ```
   http://localhost:7001/console
   ```

{{< alert title="NOTE" color="warning" >}}
It is recommended that the WebLogic Server Administration Console _not_ be exposed publicly.
