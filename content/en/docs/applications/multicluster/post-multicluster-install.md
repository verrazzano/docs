## Use the admin cluster UI

The admin cluster serves as a central point from which to register and deploy applications to managed clusters.

In the Verrazzano UI on the admin cluster, you can view the following:

- The managed clusters registered with this admin cluster.
- VerrazzanoProjects located on this admin cluster or any of its registered managed clusters, or both.
- Applications located on this admin cluster or any of its registered managed clusters, or both.
