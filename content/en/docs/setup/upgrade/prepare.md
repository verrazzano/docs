A Verrazzano installation consists of a stack of components, such as cert-manager, where each component has a
specific release version that may be different from the overall Verrazzano version.  The Verrazzano platform operator
knows the versions of each component associated with the Verrazzano version.  When you perform the initial Verrazzano
installation, the appropriate version of each component is installed by the platform operator.
Post installation, it may be necessary to update one or more of the component images or Helm charts.  This update is also
handled by the platform operator and is called an `upgrade`.  Currently, Verrazzano does only patch-level upgrades,
where a `helm upgrade` command can be issued for the component.  Typically, patch-level upgrades simply replace component
images with newer versions.

### Application and system pod restarts
If Verrazzano has a new version of Istio, then all the pods with Istio proxy sidecars
need to be restarted.  This is done so that the new version of the proxy sidecar can be injected into the pods.
All Verrazzano pods containing Istio proxy sidecars will be restarted.  This includes Verrazzano system pods,
such as the NGINX Ingress Controller, along with Verrazzano applications.  For WebLogic workloads, Verrazzano
will shut down every domain, do the upgrade, then restart every domain.  For all other workloads, Verrazzano will perform a rolling restart
when the upgrade has completed.  There is no user involvement related to restarting applications; it is done automatically during upgrade.
