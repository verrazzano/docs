## Prepare for the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure installation

* Create the [OKE](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ContEng/Concepts/contengoverview.htm) cluster using the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console or by some other means.  

* For `SHAPE`, an OKE cluster with three nodes of `VM.Standard2.4` Oracle Cloud Infrastructure [compute instance shape](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/compute/virtual-machines.html) has proven sufficient to install Verrazzano and deploy the [Bob's Books]({{< relref "/docs/samples/bobs-books.md" >}}) example application.

* Follow the instructions provided by OKE to download the Kubernetes configuration file for your cluster, and set the following `ENV` variable:

<div class="highlight">

    $ export KUBECONFIG=<path to valid Kubernetes config>

</div>
{{< /clipboard >}}

* Optional, if your organization requires the use of a private registry to the Docker images installed by Verrazzano, see [Use a Private Registry]({{< relref "/docs/setup/private-registry/private-registry.md" >}}).

**NOTE**: Verrazzano can create network policies that can be used to limit the ports and protocols that pods use for network communication. Network policies provide additional security but they are enforced only if you install a Kubernetes Container Network Interface (CNI) plug-in that enforces them, such as Calico. For an example on OKE, see [Installing Calico and Setting Up Network Policies](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ContEng/Tasks/contengsettingupcalico.htm).

{{< alert title="NOTE" color="primary" >}} OKE clusters using only the flannel overlay network is supported. OCI VCN-Native Pod Networking will not work.
