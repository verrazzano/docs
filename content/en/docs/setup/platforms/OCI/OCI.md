### Prepare for the OCI install

* Create the OKE cluster using the OCI Console or some other means.  

* For `SHAPE`, an OKE cluster with 3 nodes of `VM.Standard2.4` [OCI compute instance shape](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/compute/virtual-machines.html) has proven sufficient to install Verrazzano and deploy the Bob's Books example application.

* Set the following `ENV` vars:

```
   export KUBECONFIG=<path to valid Kubernetes config>
```

* Create the optional `imagePullSecret` named `verrazzano-container-registry`.  This step is required when one or more of the Docker images installed by Verrazzano are private.  For example, while testing a change to the `verrazzano-operator`, you may be using a Docker image that requires credentials to access it.

```
    kubectl create secret docker-registry verrazzano-container-registry \
    --docker-username=<username> \
    --docker-password=<password> \
    --docker-server=<docker server>
```
