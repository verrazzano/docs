[KIND](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) is a tool for running local Kubernetes clusters using Docker container “nodes”.  Follow
these instructions to prepare a KIND cluster for running Verrazzano.

{{% alert title="NOTE" color="warning" %}}
KIND is not recommended for use on macOS and Windows because the Docker network is not directly exposed
to the host.

## Prerequisites

- Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
- Install [KIND](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation)

## Prepare the KIND cluster

To prepare the KIND cluster for use with Verrazzano, you must create the cluster and then install and configure
[MetalLB](https://metallb.universe.tf/) in that cluster.

You can create the KIND cluster in two ways: with or without image caching; image caching can speed up your
installation time.

### Create a KIND cluster

KIND images are prebuilt for each release.  To find images suitable for a given release, check the
[release notes](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind/releases) for your KIND version (check with `kind version`).
There you'll find a complete listing of images created for a KIND release.

The following example references a Kubernetes v1.18.8-based image built for KIND v0.9.0.  Replace that image
with one suitable for the KIND release you are using.

```shell
$ kind create cluster --config - <<EOF
kind: Cluster
apiVersion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
nodes:
  - role: control-plane
    image: kindest/node:v1.18.8@sha256:f4bcc97a0ad6e7abaf3f643d890add7efe6ee4ab90baeb374b4f41a4c95567eb
    kubeadmConfigPatches:
      - |
        kind: ClusterConfiguration
        apiServer:
          extraArgs:
            "service-account-issuer": "kubernetes.default.svc"
            "service-account-signing-key-file": "/etc/kubernetes/pki/sa.key"
EOF
```

### Create a KIND cluster with image caching

While developing or experimenting with Verrazzano, you might destroy and re-create your KIND cluster multiple
times.  To speed up Verrazzano installation, follow these steps to ensure that the image cache used by
containerd inside a KIND cluster, is preserved across clusters. Subsequent installations will be faster
because they will not need to pull the images again.

1\. Create a named Docker volume that will be used for the image cache, and note its `Mountpoint` path. In this example, the volume is named `containerd`.

```shell
$ docker volume create containerd

$ docker volume inspect containerd #Sample output is shown

{
    "CreatedAt": "2021-01-11T16:27:47Z",
    "Driver": "local",
    "Labels": {},
    "Mountpoint": "/var/lib/docker/volumes/containerd/_data",
    "Name": "containerd",
    "Options": {},
    "Scope": "local"
}
```

2\. Specify the `Mountpoint` path obtained, as the `hostPath` under `extraMounts` in your KIND configuration file, with a `containerPath` of `/var/lib/containerd`, which is the default containerd image caching location inside the KIND container. An example of the modified KIND configuration is shown in the following `create cluster` command:

```shell
$ kind create cluster --config - <<EOF
kind: Cluster
apiVersion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
nodes:
  - role: control-plane
    image: kindest/node:v1.18.8@sha256:f4bcc97a0ad6e7abaf3f643d890add7efe6ee4ab90baeb374b4f41a4c95567eb
    kubeadmConfigPatches:
      - |
        kind: ClusterConfiguration
        apiServer:
          extraArgs:
            "service-account-issuer": "kubernetes.default.svc"
            "service-account-signing-key-file": "/etc/kubernetes/pki/sa.key"
    extraMounts:
      - hostPath: /var/lib/docker/volumes/containerd/_data
        containerPath: /var/lib/containerd #This is the location of the image cache inside the KIND container
EOF
```

## Install and configure MetalLB

By default, KIND does not provide an implementation of network load balancers ([Services of type LoadBalancer](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/create-external-load-balancer/)).
[MetalLB](https://metallb.universe.tf/) offers a network load balancer implementation.

To install MetalLB:

```shell
$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/metallb/metallb/v0.9.5/manifests/namespace.yaml
$ kubectl create secret generic \
    -n metallb-system memberlist \
    --from-literal=secretkey="$(openssl rand -base64 128)"
$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/metallb/metallb/v0.9.5/manifests/metallb.yaml
```

For further details, see the MetalLB [installation guide](https://metallb.universe.tf/installation/#installation-by-manifest).

MetalLB is idle until configured.  Configure MetalLB in Layer 2 mode and give it control over a range of IP addresses in the `kind` Docker network.
In versions v0.7.0 and earlier, KIND uses Docker's default bridge network; in versions v0.8.0 and later, it creates its own bridge network in KIND.

To determine the subnet of the `kind` Docker network in KIND v0.8.0 and later:

```shell
$ docker inspect kind | jq '.[0].IPAM.Config[0].Subnet' -r
172.18.0.0/16
```

To determine the subnet of the `kind` Docker network in KIND v0.7.0 and earlier:

```shell
$ docker inspect bridge | jq '.[0].IPAM.Config[0].Subnet' -r
172.17.0.0/16
```

For use by MetalLB, assign a range of IP addresses at the end of the `kind` network's subnet CIDR range.

```shell
$ kubectl apply -f - <<-EOF
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  namespace: metallb-system
  name: config
data:
  config: |
    address-pools:
    - name: my-ip-space
      protocol: layer2
      addresses:
      - 172.18.0.230-172.18.0.250
EOF
```
