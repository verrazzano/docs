Before uninstalling Verrazzano, you should delete your Verrazzano applications because they may not function properly after the uninstall operation is done.

When you uninstall Verrazzano:
* All of the Verrazzano components are uninstalled.
* The CRDs installed by Verrazzano are not deleted.
* Any applications that were deployed will still exist, but they may not be functional.
