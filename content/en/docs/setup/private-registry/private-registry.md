Verrazzano supports being able to install from a private Docker-compliant container registry, which requires:

* Loading all required Verrazzano container images into your own registry and repository.
* Installing the Verrazzano platform operator with the private registry and repository used to load the images.

To load the required Verrazzano images and prepare for an installation from your private registry, you must do the following:

* Download the TAR file containing the full set of images for the Verrazzano release from the [Oracle Software Download Center](https://www.oracle.com/downloads/).
* Extract all files from the TAR file locally and follow the instructions in the [README](https://github.com/verrazzano/verrazzano/blob/master/tools/scripts/README.md)
  file in the archive.
