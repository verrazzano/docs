Verrazzano can be configured to issue certificates to secure access from external clients to system endpoints in
the following configurations:

* Using a self-signed certificates (the default) 
* Using [LetsEncrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) as the certificate issuer (requires [OCI DNS](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/DNS/Concepts/dnszonemanagement.htm)).

In both cases, Verrazzano uses [CertManager](https://cert-manager.io/) to 
manage the creation of certificates for use by Verrazzano system components.

## Use Self-Signed Certificates

Verrazzano creates self-signed certificates as the default behavior.  No configuration is required.

Self-signed Certificate Authorities generate certificates that are NOT signed by a trusted authority; they are not typically used in production environments.

## Use LetsEncrypt Certificates

Verrazzano can be configured to use certificates generated by [LetsEncrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/).  LetsEncrypt
implements the [ACME protocol](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8555) which provides a standard protocol for the 
automated issuance of certificates signed by a trusted authority.  This is managed through the 
[`spec.components.certManager.certificate.acme`](/docs/reference/api/verrazzano/verrazzano#acme) 
field in the Verrazzano custom resource.

{{< alert title="NOTE" color="info" >}}
Using LetsEncrypt for certificates also requires using OCI DNS for DNS management.
See the [Customize DNS](/docs/setup/install/customizing/dns/) page for details.
{{< /alert >}}

In order to use configure CertManager to use LetsEncrypt as the certificates provider, you must configure a CertManager 
ACME provider with the following values in the Verrazzano custom resource:

* Set the `spec.components.certManager.certificate.acme.provider` field to `letsEncrypt`.
* Set the `spec.components.certManager.certificate.acme.emailAddress` field to a valid email address for the `letsEncrypt` account
* (Optional) Set the `spec.components.certManager.certificate.acme.environment` field to either `staging` or `production` (the default)

The following example configures Verrazzano to use the LetsEncrypt `production` environment by default with OCI DNS 
for DNS record management:

```
apiVersion: install.verrazzano.io/v1alpha1
kind: Verrazzano
metadata:
  name: letsencrypt-certs-example
spec:
  profile: dev
  components:
    certManager:
      certificate:
        acme:
          provider: letsEncrypt
          emailAddress: jane.doe@mycompany.com
    dns:
      oci:
        ociConfigSecret: oci
        dnsZoneCompartmentOCID: ocid1.compartment.oc1.....
        dnsZoneOCID: ocid1.dns-zone.oc1.....
        dnsZoneName: mydomain.com
```

The following example configures Verrazzano to use the LetsEncrypt `staging` environment with OCI DNS:

```
apiVersion: install.verrazzano.io/v1alpha1
kind: Verrazzano
metadata:
  name: letsencrypt-certs-example
spec:
  profile: dev
  components:
    certManager:
      certificate:
        acme:
          provider: letsEncrypt
          emailAddress: jane.doe@mycompany.com
          environment: staging
    dns:
      oci:
        ociConfigSecret: oci
        dnsZoneCompartmentOCID: ocid1.compartment.oc1.....
        dnsZoneOCID: ocid1.dns-zone.oc1.....
        dnsZoneName: mydomain.com
```

{{< alert title="NOTE" color="warning" >}}
Certificates issued by the LetsEncrypt `staging` environment are signed by untrusted authorities, similar to 
self-signed certificates.  They are not typically used in production environments.

### LetsEncrypt staging vs production

LetsEncrypt provides rate-limits on generated certificates to ensure fair usage across all clients.  The 
`production` environment limits can be exceeded more frequently in environments where Verrazzano may be being 
installed or reinstalled frequently (like a test environment).  This can result in failed installations due to 
rate limit exceptions on certificate generation. 

In such environments it would be better to use the LetsEncrypt `staging` environment, which has much higher limits
than the `production` environment.  For test environments, the self-signed CA also may be more appropriate to completely
avoid LetsEncrypt rate limits.
